This is a template. There are many like it, but this one is mine. 

To use it, create a MySQL database called `myNeatDB`, or, I guess you 
could change it in `config.py`, you know. Your call.

Oh, and you'll have to build the front end. From `static`, run `npm run build`. 

Then run `python3 app.py` from the root directory. It'll be up at `0.0.0.0:5000`.
